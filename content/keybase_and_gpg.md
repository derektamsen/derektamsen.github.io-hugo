If you use [Keybase](https://keybase.io) you can easily sign or encrypt things
to me. The details are on my [Keybase profile page](https://keybase.io/derektamsen).

If you would like to send me signed or encrypted stuff using
[GPG](https://www.gnupg.org/), below is my public key. You can also use `gpg` to
import my public key directly from [keyserver.ubuntu.com](http://keyserver.ubuntu.com)
using `gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --search`.

My GPG Fingerprint: `CB4C FE7D F6F7 06FE 5F4E  1581 3BB8 1FB3 7ED7 1D98`
