## devops Derek
devops Derek is a place to keep notes related to things I am working on. It makes it easier to later `grep -iR something_I_did_in_the_past ./`. Hopefully, it is also useful to others.

## Me
I'm a nerd who enjoys the inner workings of devops. In my free time I also enjoy snowboarding and going to live concerts in small venues.

I have more than ten years of experience in IT and development operations for supporting saas applications.

I try to push some of my useful stuff to git hub for others to use. You are also free to [check it out](https://github.com/derektamsen "github - derektamsen").

Feel free to follow me on twitter [@derektamsen](https://twitter.com/derektamsen "Twitter - derektamsen").

Sorry, last plug [view my linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derektamsen "View Derek Tamsen's LinkedIn profile").

> Great spirits have always encountered violent opposition from mediocre minds. The mediocre mind is incapable of understanding the man who refuses to bow blindly to conventional prejudices and chooses instead to express his opinions courageously and honestly.
