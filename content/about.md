## Devops Derek

## Me
I'm a nerd who enjoys the inner workings of devops. In my free time I also enjoy snowboarding and going to live concerts in small venues.

I have more than ten years of experience in IT and development operations for supporting saas applications.

I try to push some of my useful stuff to git hub for others to use. You are also free to [check it out](https://github.com/derektamsen "github - derektamsen").

Feel free to follow me on twitter [@derektamsen](https://twitter.com/derektamsen "Twitter - derektamsen").

Sorry, last plug [view my linkedin profile](http://www.linkedin.com/in/derektamsen "View Derek Tamsen's LinkedIn profile").
